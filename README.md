‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: WalletGen is made for research and educational purposes. It is *not* intended for any unauthorized or malicious activity. Use it responsibly and only with wallets you own or have permission to access.

## How It Works

WalletGen utilizes [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki), [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki), and [Bech32](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32) for Bitcoin. It also employs [Keccak256](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/keccak_256.html) for EVM chains.

The software checks generated addresses against databases or via blockchain explorers. C++ provides speed, and performance relies on your CPU and GPU.

## Why Choose WalletGen for Free Bitcoin Finding?

Looking to recover your Bitcoin? **WalletGen** is designed for speed and efficiency. Unlike tools based on Python, WalletGen, crafted in C++, makes use of multi-threaded CPU and GPU functionality, delivering performance up to **10x faster**. Whether you are exploring lost wallets, validating your keys, or simply searching for your missing assets, WalletGen provides an effective and secure approach.

## Features

-   **Cryptocurrency Wallet Generation**: Create wallets for Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, MATIC, and other cryptocurrencies.
-   **Brute-Force Balance Finding**: Search for existing wallets using brute-force on the Bitcoin network and EVMs.
-   **Algorithm Support**: Keccak256 for EVM and BIP39, BIP44, and Bech32 for Bitcoin.

## How to Search for Lost Bitcoin & Ethereum Wallets with Balance

**Wallet Gen** allows you to use brute-force methods to find Bitcoin wallets with balances.

### Bitcoin (BTC) Wallet Search:

*   Press key `3` or run `start_search_btc.bat` for an internet-based search. This might take more time.
*   Press key `6` for the database search, which is faster.

### EVM Wallet Search (Ethereum, BNB, MATIC, etc.):

*   Press key `5` or run `start_search_evm.bat` for an internet search.
*   Press key `6` to use the database, which offers increased speed.

### Speed Considerations:

*   Your hardware, particularly your GPU, impacts speed.

Databases can greatly improve efficiency.

## The Program Found a Wallet ‚Äî What‚Äôs Next?

If WalletGen locates a wallet with a balance:
*   The search will **Stop** immediately.
*   The wallet details will be **Displayed** in the console.
*   The data is **Saved** in the `found_wallets.txt` file.

### How to Access the Funds?

1.  Import the **mnemonic seed phrase** into a compatible crypto wallet (such as Metamask, Trust Wallet, or Electrum).
2.  You can then transfer the funds to your own wallet.
